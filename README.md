# stress-prediction

Stress has profound effects on mental and physical health, contributing to conditions like
cardiovascular diseases and depression. Current methods of stress assessment relying on self-
reporting are often subjective and unreliable. My project aims to develop an automated system
using physiological data and machine learning to objectively detect and quantify stress levels.

## steps:
1. Collect and preprocess physiological data from individuals during various stress-inducing
scenarios.
2. Implement machine learning models to classify individuals into stress levels (0 - low/normal,
1 - medium low, 2 - medium, 3 - medium high, 4 - high) categories based on the collected
physiological data.
3. Evaluate and compare the performance of different classification algorithms to identify the
most effective approach for stress detection.
4. Analyzeand Testing the results and their effectiveness and impact.

# stress-prediction

Project Overview
This project develops an innovative system to detect and quantify stress levels objectively using physiological data collected from wearable sensors. By integrating machine learning algorithms, the system classifies stress into five levels from low to high, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of stress assessments beyond traditional subjective methods.

Data Collection and Preprocessing
Collection:
The physiological data for this project is sourced from the "Human Stress Detection in and through Sleep" dataset available on Kaggle. This data includes vital signs such as heart rate, respiration rate, body temperature, and other metrics recorded during sleep.

Preprocessing:
Data preprocessing is a critical step to ensure the quality and usability of the data for machine learning models:

Noise Removal: Utilizes filtering techniques to clean the physiological signals of any artifacts or external noise, ensuring data purity.
Normalization: Standardizes the range of data features to ensure no single feature dominates the model due to its scale.
Data Balancing: Adjusts the dataset to have an equal number of samples for each stress level, preventing model bias toward more frequently occurring classes.
Model Development and Validation
Model Selection:
Several machine learning models are explored to find the most effective for stress level classification:

Logistic Regression: Offers a good baseline due to its simplicity and effectiveness in multiclass classification.
Random Forest and Gradient Boosting: These ensemble methods are known for their high accuracy and control over fitting, suitable for complex datasets like physiological data.
Model Training: Each model is trained using the prepared dataset, tuning parameters to optimize performance.
Validation:
To validate the models, cross-validation techniques are applied:

Cross-Validation: This technique enhances the robustness and generalizability of the models by using different subsets of the dataset for training and validation in multiple iterations. It helps in identifying how the model will perform with unseen data.
Outcomes and Impact
Model Performance:
The models demonstrate high accuracy in classifying stress levels, with Logistic Regression performing exceptionally well, suggesting its suitability for deployment in real-world applications.
